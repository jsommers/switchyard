<p>To run Switchyard in test mode, a <em>test scenario</em> file is needed.  This file includes specifications of various events (sending particularly crafted packets, receiving packets, etc.) that a Switchyard program is expected to do if it behaves correctly.  Also needed, of course, is the Switchyard program you wish to test.  The test scenario files may be regular Python (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code>) files, but they may alternatively have an extension <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.srpy</span></code> if they have been <em>compiled</em>.  For details on creating and compiling test scenarios, see <a class="reference internal" href="test_scenario_creation.html#test-scenario-creation"><span class="std std-ref">Test scenario creation</span></a>.</p>
<p>Let’s say your program is named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">myhub.py</span></code>.  To invoke Switchyard in test mode and subject your program to a set of tests, at minimum you would invoke <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">swyard</span></code> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ swyard -t hubtests.srpy myhub
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-t</span></code> option puts <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">swyard</span></code> in test mode.  The argument to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-t</span></code> option should be the name of the test scenario to be executed, and the final argument is the name of your code.  It doesn’t matter whether you include the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code> extension on the end of your program name, so:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ swyard -t hubtests.srpy myhub.py
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>would work the same as above.</p>
<section id="test-output">

<p>When you run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">swyard</span></code> in test mode and all tests pass, you’ll see something similar to the following:</p>

<p>Note that the above output has been truncated — output would normally be shown for all tests.  When invoked with the <em>verbose</em> option, individual tests show exactly what packets would be expected (either as input to a device or as output from it).</p>
<p><em>Test scenario</em> descriptions that drive test executions as shown here are composed of a series of test <em>expectations</em>.  Test expectations may be that a packet is received on a particular port, or that a packet is emitted out one or more ports, or that the user code calls <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">recv_packet</span></code> but times out (and thus nothing is received).  Both the abbreviated and verbose test output shown above contain brief descriptions of the nature of each test.  In the verbose output, packet details related to each test are also shown.  Reading this information can help to understand what the tests are trying to accomplish, especially when a test expectation fails.</p>

<section id="when-a-test-fails">
<h2>When a test fails<a class="headerlink" href="#when-a-test-fails" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>If some test expectation is not met, then the output indicates that something has gone wrong and, by default, Switchyard gives the user the standard Python pdb debugger prompt.  The motivation for immediately putting the user in pdb is to enable just-in-time debugging.  If the test output is read carefully and can be used to identify a flaw by inspecting code and data at the time of failure, then this should help to facilitate the development/testing/debugging cycle.  At least that’s the hope.</p>
<p>Say that we’ve done something wrong in our code which causes a test expectation to fail.  The output we see might be similar to the following (note that to create the output below, we’ve used the full set of hub device tests, but the code we’ve used is the broken code we started with in <a class="reference internal" href="writing_a_program.html#coding"><span class="std std-ref">Writing a Switchyard program</span></a> that sends any packet back out the same port that it arrived on):</p>

<p>Notice in the first line of output that Switchyard shows how many tests pass, how many have
failed, and how many are <em>pending</em>.  The pending category simply means that tests cannot be run because some earlier test failed.   In the example above, the output from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">swyard</span></code> clearly shows which test fails; when that happens, some additional explanatory text is shown, and a debugger session is started as close as possible to the point of failure.  When not run in verbose mode, Switchyard will show abbreviated test descriptions for any passed tests and any pending tests, but the failed test will show everything.</p>
<p>Following the overall test results showing passed, failed, and pending tests, some summary information is displayed about the test failure, and a debugging session is started.  By default, Switchyard uses Python’s built-in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code> debugger.  At the very end of the output, a stack trace is shown and a debugger prompt is displayed:</p>

 Your code didn&#39;t crash, but a test failed.
 ************************************************************

 This is the Switchyard equivalent of the blue screen of death.
 As far as I can tell, here&#39;s what happened:

     Expected event:
         The Ethernet frame with a broadcast destination address
         should be forwarded out ports eth0 and eth2

     Failure observed:
         You called send_packet with an unexpected output port eth1.
         Here is what Switchyard expected: send_packet(s) Ethernet
         30:00:00:00:00:02-&gt;ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff IP | IPv4

         172.16.42.2-&gt;255.255.255.255 ICMP | ICMP EchoRequest 0 0 (0
         data bytes) out eth2.

 You can rerun with the -v flag to include full dumps of packets that
 may have caused errors. (By default, only relevant packet context may
 be shown, not the full contents.)


 I&#39;m throwing you into the Python debugger (pdb) at the point of failure.
 If you don&#39;t want pdb, use the --nopdb flag to avoid this fate.

<p>Again, notice that the last couple lines show a (partial) stack trace.   These lines can help a bit to understand the context of the error, but it is often helpful to show the source code around the failed code in light of the error diagnosis under “Failure observed”, which says that we called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">send_packet</span></code> with an unexpected output port. If we keep reading the diagnosis, we see that the packet was expected to be forwarded out two ports (eth0 and eth2), but was instead sent on eth1.  Showing the source code can be accomplished with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code>’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code> command:</p>

 ************************************************************
 Your code didn&#39;t crash, but a test failed.
 ************************************************************

 This is the Switchyard equivalent of the blue screen of death.
 As far as I can tell, here&#39;s what happened:

     Expected event:
         The Ethernet frame with a broadcast destination address
         should be forwarded out ports eth0 and eth2

     Failure observed:
         You called send_packet and while the output port eth0 is ok,
         an exact match of packet contents failed.  In the Ethernet
         header, src is wrong (is ba:ba:ba:ba:ba:ba but should be
         30:00:00:00:00:02).

 ... output continues ...
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this case, we can see that the first section is basically the same as with the other erroneous code, but the failure description is different:  Switchyard tells us that in the Ethernet header, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src</span></code> attribute was wrong.  If, at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code> prompt, we type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code>, we see our wooly problem:</p>
<div class="literal-block-wrapper docutils container" id="id7">

  28             else:
  29                 for intf in my_interfaces:

</div>
<p>So, although the error diagnosis cannot generally state <em>why</em> a problem has happened, it can sometimes be quite specific about <em>what</em> has gone wrong.  That, coupled with showing the source code context, can be very helpful for tracking down bugs.  It might also be helpful to note that at the pdb prompt, you can inspect <em>any</em> variable in order to figure out what’s happened, walk up and down the call stack and execute arbitrary Python statements in order to try to determine what has happened.  Debuggers can be a little bit daunting, but they’re incredibly helpful tools.</p>

<p>To learn more about pdb and the various commands and capabilities it has, refer to the Python library documentation (there’s a section specifically on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code>).  There are other debuggers out there with additional features, but <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code> is <em>always</em> available with any Python distribution so it is worth acquainting yourself with it.</p>

<p>If you’d like to use a debugger, but just not <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code>, you can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--nohandle</span></code> (or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-e</span></code>) option to tell Switchyard not to trap any exceptions, but to let them be raised normally.  You can then catch any exceptions using an alterative debugger.  For example, if you’d like to use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PuDB</span></code> debugger, you could invoke <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">swyard</span></code> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python3 -m pudb.run swyard --nohandle ...
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where the ellipsis is replaced with other command-line arguments to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">swyard</span></code>.</p>

<p>When running Switchyard, especially in test mode, it is often very helpful to use the interactive Python debugger as you work out problems and figure things out.  With the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">import</span></code> of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">switchyard.lib.userlib</span></code> you get a function named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">debugger</span></code>.  You can insert calls to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">debugger</span></code> function where ever you want to have an interactive debugger session start up.   For example, we could create a simple program that starts up a debugger session when ever we receive a packet:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">switchyard.lib.userlib</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>There are currently a couple limitations when entering <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code> through a call to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">debugger()</span></code>.  First, if you attempt to exit <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code> while the Switchyard program is still running, an exception from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code>’s base class (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bdb</span></code>) will get raised.  Thus, it may take a couple invocations of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">quit</span></code> command to actually exit.  Second, only the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code> debugger may be invoked through a call to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">debugger</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<p>As noted above, if there is a runtime error in your code, Switchyard will automatically dump you into the Python debugger (pdb) to see exactly where the program crashed and what may have caused it.  You can use any Python commands to inspect variables, and try to understand the state of the program at the time of the crash.</p>

<h2>Checking code coverage<a class="headerlink" href="#checking-code-coverage" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you want to check which lines of code are <em>covered</em> by one or more test scenarios, you can install and use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">coverage</span></code> package.  This can be helpful for seeing which lines of your code are <em>not</em> being exercised by tests, and how you might focus additional testing effort.</p>
<p>To install:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ pip3 install coverage
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To gather code coverage information, you can invoke <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">swyard</span></code> using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">coverage</span></code>.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">coverage</span></code> appears to work best if you give the full path name of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">swyard</span></code>, which is what the following command line will do (using backtick-substitution for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">swyard</span></code> command).  You can use command-line options to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">swyard</span></code> as you normally would:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ coverage run `which swyard` -v -d -t testscenario.py yourcode.py
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once you’ve created the coverage information you can display a report.  The html report will nicely show exactly which lines of your code were executed during a test and which weren’t.  To avoid seeing coverage information for irrelevant files, you should explicitly tell <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">coverage</span></code> which files you want to include in the report.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ coverage html --include yourcode.py
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After running the above command, you can open the file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">index.html</span></code> within the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">htmlcov</span></code> folder.  Clicking on a file name will show detailed coverage information.</p>
